When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Remote repositories are useful when collaborating for a project with others, or to share code
  and be able to see it elsewhere. It also allows for access from different machines, as the 
  work files are not only stored locally. Additionally, a remote repository can serve as
  backup for files.
